# Why

You didn't really configure nginx logging, nor the sending of the logs in a dedicated database.

You just have the standard logs of nginx and you'd like to have an idea of what happened recently.

This program finds, reads, unzip if necessary, the log files, checks their consistency, does some basic analysis and tells you about it in pretty tables in your console.

That's all.

Maybe you'll be less lazy next time and you'll beef your logging solution.

I won't.
