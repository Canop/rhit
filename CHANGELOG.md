### v1.3.0 - 2021-02-18
Many changes in the arguments you give to rhit:
- `tables` have been renamed `fields`
- `addr` (remote IP addresses) has been changed to `ip` both in fields list and as filter
- instead of a `trends` table, there's a `--changes` argument (short: `-c`)
- with `--changes`, you see more popular and less popular referers
- with `--changes`, you see more popular and less popular remote ip adresses if the ip field is shown (eg with `rhit -f date,ip -c`)
- date filters can be negative or inequalities (eg: `-d '>2021/02/10'`)

<a name="v1.2.0"></a>

- the `--key` argument defines the key measure, either 'hits' (default) or 'bytes' (of the response) used for sorting and filtering, and highlighted in pink

- trends in all tables

<a name="v1.1.1"></a>
### v1.1.1 - 2021-02-10
