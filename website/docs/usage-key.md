By default all tables are sorted by **hits**.

This is the sorting key.

All vallues of the sorting key are displayed in <span class=pink>pink</span>, including the histograms.

If you're more interested in the total sizes in sent bytes, you may change the sorting key to **bytes**.

You do this change with `--key bytes` or `-k b`.

This will impact the selection of lines at the top of tables, the histograms and the trend computations.

Here's an example with first a sort by hits, then one by bytes:
