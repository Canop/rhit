# Discuss Rhit in a chat room

The best place to chat about rhit, to talk about features or bugs, is the Miaou chat.

* [Rust & Rhit room on Miaou](https://miaou.dystroy.org/3490?rust)
* [French Programers room on Miaou](https://miaou.dystroy.org/3)

# Issues

We use [GitHub's issue manager](https://github.com/Canop/rhit/issues).

Before posting a new issue, check your problem hasn't already been raised and in case of doubt **please come first discuss it on the chat**.

## Log

When something looks like a bug, we need both to know the exact configuration (OS, terminal program, mainly) and to have the log. The log can be obtained this way:

1. execute rhit with `RHIT_LOG=debug rhit`
1. go to the chat (or the GitHub issue if you already made one) and paste the content of the `rhit.log` file
